Discrete Math Notes

Tautalogy: An expression which will always evaluate to true
Contradiction: An expression which will always evaluate to false

= Symbols
AND is: ^ (upward arrow)
OR is:  V (downward arrow)
NOT is: ¬ (special symbol, can use "!" for plain text?)

= De Morgan's Laws

How distributing a negation into parentheses works:

>> ¬(p V q) equivalent_to (¬p ^ ¬q)
